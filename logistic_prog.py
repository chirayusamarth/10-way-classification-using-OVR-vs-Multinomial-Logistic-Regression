Do not change the input and output format.
If our script cannot run your code or the format is improper, your code will not be graded.

The only functions you need to implement in this template is logistic_bin_train, logistic_bin_test, logistic_mul_train, logistic_mul_test. You are also not supposed to modify any function other than these 4 functions. Please go through the instructions and comments in this file.
